# FizzBuzz Problem

Design an API which Returns data as Fizz Buzz Pattern:
 - A program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
 - For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
 - For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
 - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

# Run the app locally

 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` - This will start the application and run on port 8080
 - `npm run dev` - This will start the application in development mode
 - `npm run test` - Runs all the test cases - unit test cases + integration tests

# Run the app - Swagger UI 

- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui`
